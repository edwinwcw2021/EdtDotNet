This demo application was initially developed for code assessment purposes. However, I hope it can also serve as a useful resource for new programmers learning how to use SQL Server, .NET Core for database connectivity, and Entity Framework with AngularJS.



Technologies Used:

Database: MSSQL 2022 Developer Edition

Frontend: Angular v19 (developed using Visual Studio Code)

Backend: C# .NET Core 8.0

Development Tools: Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition

Web Server: Nginx Reverse Proxy

Other: HTML, JavaScript, Certbot SSL


Features:

Users can search for books on the Book page, with results returning 100,000 records in less than one second thanks to the caching technology implemented.
Borrowed books are displayed on the Borrowed page.
